# Maze Game

I developed a couple versions of a maze game on the [Arduino UNO R4 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/products/uno-r4-wifi), which includes an onboard LED matrix, which I use to display the maze.

The general idea is to generate a maze and display it on the LED matrix, then allow input from 4 buttons to control the player (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT). To indicate the player position in the maze I used a single blinking LED.  

In each version I have played around with extra features, displays and feedback.  

The obvious goal: ***escape the maze***.
